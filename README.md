# TwistGolf
The card game 'Golf' with a local twist.

# Overview

Golf is a multiplayer game that deals out 6 random cards from a pregenerated deck of 50 cards. The players then flip 2 cards. The lowest score of 2 cards wins. Kings count as negative 4 points. If there are 2 of the same card in a row (ei. 3 hearts and 3 spades), then that row counts as 0 points. Players take turns flipping a card, drawing a card, or taking from the discard pile. 

My family loves to play card games. This is one that we enjoy playing together and I thought it would be a fun game to program.

I developed in VS code with Python extention.

I used Python for back end and Tkinter for front end. Playsound was utilized for audio. PIL was utilized for images.
